# Big Data Projects

This directory contains hands-on projects that apply big data concepts, tools, and techniques. Each project is designed to build practical skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization at scale.

## Project List

1. **Simple Data Analysis** - Basic data analysis using Python and Pandas
2. **Web Scraping & ETL** - Extracting and processing web data
3. **Big Data Processing with PySpark** - Large-scale data processing
4. **Real-time Data Pipeline** - Streaming data with Kafka and Spark Streaming
5. **Machine Learning at Scale** - Distributed machine learning with PySpark MLlib
6. **Data Warehousing** - Building a data warehouse with PostgreSQL and dbt
7. **Data Visualization Dashboard** - Interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash
8. **Natural Language Processing** - Text analysis and processing at scale
9. **Computer Vision with Big Data** - Image processing with PySpark
10. **End-to-End Project** - Complete big data pipeline from ingestion to insights

## Getting Started

Each project includes:
- A detailed README with project overview and objectives
- Required dependencies and setup instructions
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Sample datasets or data generation scripts
- Expected outputs and deliverables

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab (for interactive projects)
- Docker (for containerized environments)
- Apache Spark (for distributed processing projects)
- PostgreSQL (for database projects)
