## Introduction

Stream processing architectures define how data flows through a system, how it's processed, and how results are stored and made available. Choosing the right architecture is crucial for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable streaming applications.

## Lambda Architecture

Lambda Architecture is designed to handle both batch and real-time processing paths.

### Key Components

1. **Batch Layer**
   - Processes all available data
   - Ensures data accuracy and completeness
   - High latency (minutes to hours)
   - Example: Daily aggregation of user activities

2. **Speed Layer**
   - Processes only new data
   - Provides low-latency results
   - Approximate but quick answers
   - Example: Real-time dashboard updates

3. **Serving Layer**
   - Merges batch and real-time views
   - Provides query interface
   - Example: Combined view of historical and real-time metrics

### Implementation Example

```python
# Pseudo-code for Lambda Architecture

def batch_processing():
    # Process all historical data
    full_dataset = load_historical_data()
    batch_view = compute_batch_view(full_dataset)
    batch_view.save_to_serving_layer()

def speed_processing():
    # Process new data in real-time
    stream = connect_to_stream()
    for event in stream:
        realtime_view.update(event)
        serving_layer.merge_views(batch_view, realtime_view)

# Scheduled batch processing (e.g., daily)
schedule.every().day.at("02:00").do(batch_processing)

# Continuous speed processing
speed_processing()
```

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Accurate results from batch layer | Complexity of maintaining two codebases |
| Low-latency from speed layer | Need to handle consistency between layers |
| Fault-tolerant | Higher operational overhead |

## Kappa Architecture

Kappa Architecture simplifies Lambda by using a single processing layer.

### Key Principles

1. **Single Processing Layer**
   - Only stream processing is used
   - Historical data is replayed through the same code
   - Simpler maintenance and operations

2. **Event Sourcing**
   - All data is stored as a sequence of events
   - Complete history is preserved
   - Enables time-travel analysis

### Implementation Example

```python
# Pseudo-code for Kappa Architecture

def process_stream(stream, start_time=None):
    if start_time:
        # Replay historical data if needed
        historical_data = load_historical_data(since=start_time)
        for event in historical_data:
            process_event(event)
    
    # Process new events
    for event in stream:
        process_event(event)
        store_event(event)  # Append to event log

def process_event(event):
    # Single processing logic for both batch and real-time
    update_real_time_views(event)
    update_analytical_views(event)
```

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Single codebase | Requires careful design of event schema |
| Simpler operations | May need large storage for event log |
| Better consistency | Replay can be resource-intensive |

## Stateful Stream Processing

Stateful processing maintains context across events, enabling complex operations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Operator State**
   - Local to an operator instance
   - Example: Count of events per key

2. **Keyed State**
   - Scoped to a specific key
   - Example: User session data

3. **Checkpointing**
   - Periodically saves state
   - Enables fault tolerance

### Implementation Example (Apache Flink)

```java
// Example of stateful processing in Flink
public class StatefulProcessingJob {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
        
        // Enable checkpointing every 10 seconds
        env.enableCheckpointing(10000);
        
        // Define the source
        DataStream<Tuple2<String, Integer>> dataStream = env
            .addSource(new CustomSource())
            .keyBy(0)  // Key by the first field
            .process(new StatefulProcessFunction());
            
        // Execute the job
        env.execute("Stateful Processing Example");
    }
    
    public static class StatefulProcessFunction 
        extends KeyedProcessFunction<Tuple, Tuple2<String, Integer>, String> {
        
        private ValueState<Integer> state;
        
        @Override
        public void open(Configuration parameters) {
            // Initialize state
            ValueStateDescriptor<Integer> descriptor =
                new ValueStateDescriptor<>("counter", TypeInformation.of(Integer.class));
            state = getRuntimeContext().getState(descriptor);
        }
        
        @Override
        public void processElement(
            Tuple2<String, Integer> value,
            Context ctx,
            Collector<String> out) throws Exception {
                
            // Get current count
            Integer currentCount = state.value();
            if (currentCount == null) {
                currentCount = 0;
            }
            
            // Update count
            currentCount += value.f1;
            state.update(currentCount);
            
            // Emit result
            out.collect("Key: " + value.f0 + ", Count: " + currentCount);
        }
    }
}
```

## Event Sourcing and CQRS

### Event Sourcing

- Store all changes as a sequence of events
- Rebuild state by replaying events
- Enables audit trail and temporal queries

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

- Separate read and write models
- Optimize each for its purpose
- Can be combined with event sourcing

### Implementation Example

```python
# Pseudo-code for Event Sourcing with CQRS

class EventStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []
    
    def append(self, event):
        self.events.append(event)
        self.publish_event(event)
    
    def get_events(self, aggregate_id):
        return [e for e in self.events if e.aggregate_id == aggregate_id]

class CommandHandler:
    def __init__(self, event_store):
        self.event_store = event_store
    
    def handle_command(self, command):
        # Validate command
        # Generate events
        event = self.process_command(command)
        # Store events
        self.event_store.append(event)


class ReadModel:
    def __init__(self, event_store):
        self.state = {}
        self.rebuild(event_store.events)
    
    def rebuild(self, events):
        for event in events:
            self.apply_event(event)
    
    def apply_event(self, event):
        # Update read model based on event
        pass
```
