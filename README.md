## Getting Started

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Install Miniconda (if not already installed)
   # Create and activate environment
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate bigdata-env
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Learning Path

1. Start with Python fundamentals : done 
2. Move to data processing with Pandas and NumPy
3. Learn about the Big Data ecosystem
4. Work on real-world projects

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
